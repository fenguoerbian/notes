This repo stores some notes.

Existing topics are:

- Hypothesis testing: 

    - Different testings, such as t-test, binomial test and chisq test
    
    - Concepts in testing, such as chance (tolerance probability)

    - MDD and related concepts

    - Conditional power (work in progress)

- Survival analysis: 
    
    - basic concept, logrank test and Cox's PH model

    - Bayesian parametric model and Go/Nogo design

- Fisher's information

- Gamma and Beta distribution

- misc information, such as STDM and ADAM, etc.

- Some Bayesian concepts, such as prior/posterior distribution, prior/posterior predictive distribution and different methods to get credible interval.

- to be added.

Upcoming topics are:

- Some Bayesian monitoring concepts, for categorical/TTE end points go/nogo design.

- BOIN and BLRM in early stage design, for single agent or combo agents.

- Multiple testing: gatekeeping, fixed-sequence, fallback, close-set testing procedure

- Multiple imputation: classic MI and Rubin's rule, joint model(JM) and full conditional specification(FCS, MICE), reference/control based MI

- Mixed model: MMRM, etc.

- Alpha spending functions
